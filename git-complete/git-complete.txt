# Introduction

- two main types of source control options are centralized and decentralized / distributed
- centralized requires conneciton to central server for most operations
- distributed allows most operations to be local and a central server is not required

- git is a distributed source / version control system, though it's not required to be decentralized
- benefits of git include:
  - version control
  - massively scalable, very fast
  - open source
  - most operations are local
  - active community, most popular DVCS / VCS

- repository contains files, history, config managed by git
- three local states of git:
  - working directory - local copy, also contains the repository aka .git folder
  - staging area - pre-commit holding area
  - commit - .git repository (history)
- remote repository is where you push your local working directory to

# Git Quick Start

- git configurations on a new machine:
  $ git config --global user.name "Alena McLucas"
  $ git config --global user.email "alenamclucas@gmail.com"
  $ git config --global --list

- create a new remote git repository (github, bitbucket):
  - write repository name, no capitals or spaces
  - write a short description
  - initialize a README, which will include the repository name and description in the file

- clone new repository locally:
  - copy clone HTTPS URL to clipboard
  $ git clone [paste clone URL]

$ git status
// Tells us where each file in our working directory is:
  // Untracked means a file is on our working directory but not in our repository / .git folder yet
  // New files means the file is now in the staging 
  // Your branch is ahead of master means there are committed changes not pushed to the remote repository
  // working directory clean means if there are no discrepancies between the working directory and .git folder

$ git add .
// Adds all of the new files in the working directory, can also replace the . with the new file name(s)
